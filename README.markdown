The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:

* Red Apples
* Purple Grapes
* Green Kiwifruits

Let's get crazy:

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

What about some code **in** a list? That's insane, right?

1. In Ruby you can map like this:

        ['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }

2. In Rails, you can do a shortcut:

        ['a', 'b'].map(&:uppercase)



<dl>
  <dt>Lower cost</dt>
  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>

I am a robot
------------

Maybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not?

    def robot_invasion
      puts("robot " * 1000)
    end

You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.

How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?

    <div class="footer">
        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
    </div>



Playing the blame game

Table for two
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Crazy linking action
--------------------

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

  [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
